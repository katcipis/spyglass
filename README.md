# Spyglass

Spyglass is a monitoring system for websites

# Why ?

On this section I describe the reasoning of some of the design
decisions.

## Code Style

I really like the Go's approach of instead of discussing code style
just use automation to ensure consistency, like the Go proverb:

```
Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.
```

For this project I chose the [PEP8 style checker](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/).
